                    <h2>OWNERSHIP AND USE</h2>
                    <p>ReportGrid is the owner of the information collected on the Site and through the Services.  We will not sell, share, transfer, or use this information other than as stated in this Policy.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>REPORTGRID CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES.</h2> 
                    <p>Certain of the web sites of ReportGrid's customers, advertisers or affiliates and other third-parties may be accessible through the Site or Services.  You may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (or other information) to these third parties through these web sites, including by way of example when you click on a link on the Site to one of these other web sites.  These customers and third parties maintain their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  This Policy covers only the Site and Services and does not extend to our customers or any third parties.  REPORTGRID IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLICIES OR PRACTICES OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR ANY THIRD PARTIES.  YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE APPLICABLE PRIVACY POLICIES OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND ANY THIRD PARTIES BEFORE PROVIDING THEM WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>REGISTERED USERS.</h2>
                    <p>Registration is not mandatory to access the public areas of the Site.  Registration is, however, required for access to certain areas of the Site and the use of certain of the Services provided through those areas of the Site.  The areas of the Site requiring registration are noted on the Site.  
                    Users registering to receive an account on the Site will be provided with a username and password for purposes of accessing their account and the portions of the Site available to account holders. When accessing the portions of the Site available to account holders, and using the Services provided through those areas of the Site, users may be required to provide their username and password.  
                    ReportGrid is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password.  ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD WITH OTHERS.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</h2>
                    <p>We only collect and share personally identifiable information regarding users of the Site or Services as described in this Policy.  Except as noted in this Policy, personally identifiable information collected on the Site or through the Services is NOT shared with third parties without your consent.  
                    We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you access the Site or use or access the Services.  We may also collect personally identifiable information from you through a number of voluntary sources on the Site and through the Services, such as responses, registrations, surveys, reviews, comments, confirmations, emails, postings, messages or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to the Site or through Services.  The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will include, by way of example:</p>

                            If you register for the Site or Services through a third-party site or service, the personally identifiable information you have provided in connection with your account on that third-party site or service may be imported into your account on the Site.  The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will also include any information imported from any such account on any third-party site.  
                            The personally identifiable information that ReportGrid collects from users of the Site or Services (both registered and unregistered) may be used for a variety of purposes, including by way of example:

                        <li><p class="teamtext">We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect through the Site or Services with third party companies so that they may offer products and services to users of our Site or Services that we believe will be of interest to those users.  We may also share certain personally identifiable information with third party advertisement serving companies to better target the advertising and other content displayed on the Site or Services and provide pertinent offers we think may be of interest to our users.  In addition, third party advertisers may receive certain personally identifiable information about you if you click on advertisements displayed on the Site or through the Services.  Clicking on any advertisement displayed on the Site or through the Services will be considered your consent to "opt in" for this transfer.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h1>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</h1>
                    <p>Where possible, our server automatically recognizes and collects certain non-personally identifiable information regarding visitors to the Site and users of the Services, including by way of example, IP address, browser type, and other information regarding the system and connection of each visitor or user.  We also collect information about how visitors access and use the Site and Services, including by way of example what pages of the Site are viewed and what portions of services are used.  This information allows us to improve the content of the Site and Services, facilitate research and analysis of the Site and Services, and develop and refine our Services.  Sometimes, we utilize the services of a third party to help us understand this information better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at all times in anonymous and non-personally identifiable form.  Other than improving the Site and Services, and the experience of visitors to the Site and users of the Services, we make no other use of this information.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>DISCLOSURE AS REQUIRED BY LAW.</h2>
                    <p>Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of the Site or Services when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect ReportGrid's rights under applicable law, including, without limitation, ReportGrid's intellectual property rights.  In this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>ENHANCEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h2>
                    <p>We may combine and enhance our user database information with third party data and information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which we think our users would be interested.  Certain summary demographics are also used in our research product offerings.  Individual personally identifiable information is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual user or resold for any purposes.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS.</h2>
                    <p>On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements.  For instance, if the Site or any of the Services is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.  These communications are not promotional in nature. </p>
                    
                    <h2>SPECIAL OFFERS AND UPDATES.</h2>
                    <p>We may send new registrants of the Site or Services a welcoming email to verify password and username.  Established members may occasionally also receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.  Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.   </p>
                    
                    <h2>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.</h2>
                    <p>California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their personally identifiable information has been shared with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes.  However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person's personally identifiable information to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.  
                    ReportGrid has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception.  Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled "Choice and Opt-Out."  </p>
                    
                    <h2>CHOICE AND OPT-OUT.</h2>
                    <p>We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails and other communications through the Site and Services.  
                    We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes.  If you are a user of the Site or Services and you no longer wish to receive emails, mail, or telephone calls from us or have your email address or postal address shared with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving email, mail or telephone calls from us or having your email address or postal address shared with third parties.
                    In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.  
                    All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: contact@reportgrid.com.</p>
                    
                    <h2>CHILDREN.</h2>
                    <p>The Site and Services are not directed to children under 13 years of age.  ReportGrid does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>CUSTOMER SERVICE.</h2> 
                    <p>We provide customer service as set forth in our Terms of Service.  We communicate with users to provide these services in accordance with our Terms of Service.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS.</h2> 
                    <p>"Cookies" include commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and Services.  We may use cookies on the site or in communications sent through the Services for various purposes, including by way of example: 
                    Saving user preferences; 
                    Customizing content of the Site for individual users;
                    Ensuring that users are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads; 
                    Recording session information; 
                    Saving certain information about users of the Site and others who visit the Site; and 
                    Facilitating and enhancing interaction with the Site.  
                    ReportGrid does not use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to ReportGrid or the Site or Services.  
                    A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personally identifying information; however, we may link the information obtained through cookies to other personally identifiable information to give us a better understanding of your preferences, so that we can provide a more meaningful experience to you on our Site and through our Services.  
                    "Web beacons" (also known as "single–pixel" or "clear" GIFs) include electronic images imbedded in the Site or sent through the Services which are invisible to users.  Web beacons collect information, such as identifiers, time and date of access, and descriptions of the pages or communications in which the web beacons are imbedded.  The Site and Services may include web beacons.  We may use the web beacons on the Site and Services for various purposes, including by way of example to track users who have visited our Site, viewed advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the Services, or otherwise accessed communications sent through the Services.   
                    We may use an outside advertisement serving company to display advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the Services.  The advertisement serving company may place and collect cookies or web beacons when it displays an advertisement on the Site or through the Services.  We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies or web beacons by the advertisement serving company.  We may also use a third party provider to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site and the communications sent through Services.  This third party provider may use cookies or web beacons to collect such information.
                    Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  You may also be able to refuse certain web beacons by adjusting the settings on your browser or email software.  Please refer to your browser or email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.  </p>
                    
                    <h2>ACCESS, REVIEW, UPDATE.</h2>
                    <p>The users of the Site or Services should visit our website at http://reportgrid.com or email us at contact@reportgrid.com to review, delete, deactivate, update or change any personal information that was previously provided to or collected by ReportGrid.</p>
                    
                    <h2>CONSENT TO THE USE OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS.</h2>
                    <p>In addition to the specific third parties noted in this Policy, ReportGrid may also contract with other third parties to provide various services to ReportGrid relating to the Site or Services on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself.  For example, ReportGrid may contract with a web site hosting provider to host all or a portion of the Site or Services for ReportGrid.  By visiting the Site or using the Services, all visitors consent to ReportGrid providing both personal and non-personal information received from those visitors to these third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to ReportGrid.  In addition, all visitors consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their personal and non-personal information by ReportGrid and these third party providers.</p>  
                    
                    <h2>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES.</h2>
                    <p>If we decide to change this Policy, we will either notify users by way of an e-mail or post material changes on the Site so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and if we disclose it.  Unless we seek and receive your consent, we will use information in accordance with the Policy under which the information was last collected.  Users may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by emailing us at contact@ReportGrid.com.</p>
                    
                    <h2>SECURITY.</h2>
                    <p>We will use at least industry standard security measures on the Site to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal information.  For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific job are granted access to that personally identifiable information.  Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.</p> 
                    
                    <h2>CONTACT INFORMATION.</h2>
                    <p>All inquiries concerning this Policy and the Site or Services in general may be sent to contact@ReportGrid.com.</p>
                    
                    <h2>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.</h2>  
                    <p>If ReportGrid elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of the Site or Services to a third party, whether or not in the context of an acquisition, merger, or reorganization, you consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information by ReportGrid to that third party, provided that all use of your information by that third party remains subject to the terms of this Policy.

                    <h2>INDEMNITY.  </h2>
                    <p>By ReportGrid.  Except in the case of any Services provided during a Trial/Free Subscription, ReportGrid will, at its expense, defend You against any claims brought against You by a third party that Your use of the Services in accordance with this Agreement infringes any copyright, trade secret or trademark right.

If You are, or ReportGrid reasonably believes You may be, enjoined from using the Services, ReportGrid, at ReportGrid's option and expense, may procure the right for You to continue using the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing, or provide You a refund of all pre-paid amounts applicable to such Services (if any) and terminate this Agreement with respect to such Services.  This Section  REF _Ref306781514 \w \h 17.1 constitutes ReportGrid's sole and exclusive liability, and Your sole and exclusive remedy, for any infringement or misappropriation of any third party IPR by or through the Site, Services, Technology, ReportGrid Content or any Software.  
                    By You.

                    <h2>LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.</h2>
                    <p>IN NO EVENT WILL REPORTGRID BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE), ARISING IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OR OUT OF THE USE OF THE SITE, SERVICES (OR ANY REPORTGRID CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES), EVEN IF REPORTGRID HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF DATA, OPPORTUNITY, REVENUES OR PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES.  REPORTGRID'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID TO REPORTGRID HEREUNDER IN THE 1 MONTH PRECEDING ANY SUCH INITIAL OCCURRENCE OF LIABILITY (OR, IF NO SUCH FEES HAVE BEEN PAID, $10).  YOU AGREE THAT THE FEES REFLECT THE ALLOCATION OF RISK SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REPORTGRID WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON ITS LIABILITY.  IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES IS NOT PERMITTED, REPORTGRID'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.  </p>
                  
                    <h2>DATA PRIVACY.</h2>
                    <p>You expressly consent to the use and disclosure of personally identifiable and other data and information as described in ReportGrid's then-current privacy policy displayed on the Site ("Privacy Policy").

Each party agrees to protect the other party's Confidential Information with the degree of care that such party uses to protect its own confidential information of like nature, but in no case less than reasonable care.  Each party agrees that, except as expressly directed by the other party, it will not at any time during or after the term of this Agreement: (1) disclose any Confidential Information to any third party; (2) permit any third party to examine and/or make copies of any reports, documents or electronic data containing Confidential Information; or (3) use any of the Confidential Information for any reason other than for the purposes of this Agreement.  Each party may disclose Confidential Information to personnel having a need to receive the Confidential Information in the performance of their duties under this Agreement, provided, however, that such personnel are informed of the confidentiality obligations hereunder and each party uses its best efforts to ensure their compliance therewith.  If either party is required to disclose the other party's Confidential Information pursuant to any statute, regulation, order, subpoena or document discovery request, it will furnish written notice of such disclosure to the other party as soon as practicable to afford such party the opportunity to seek a protective order and the party required to make such disclosure  will reasonably cooperate in such efforts (at the other party's reasonable expense).  In the event of any conflict between the Privacy Policy and the provisions of this Section  REF _Ref306782683 \w \h 20, the provisions of this Section  REF _Ref306782683 \w \h 20 shall control.  </p>

If any Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations between the parties within 5 days of notice from one party to the other of the Dispute, such Dispute will be finally settled through binding arbitration under the arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") then in effect (the "Rules").  Either party may commence the arbitration by delivering a request for arbitration as specified in the Rules.  The arbitration will be conducted before a sole neutral arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties.  If the parties cannot agree on the appointment of a single arbitrator within 30 days (the "Initial Period") after either party to this Agreement delivers a request for arbitration, a neutral arbitrator will be selected as provided in the Rules.  The arbitration will be conducted exclusively in the English language at a site specified by ReportGrid in Denver, Colorado U.S.A.  The award of the arbitrator will be the exclusive remedy of the parties for all claims, counterclaims, issues or accountings presented or plead to the arbitrator.  The award of the arbitrators will require payment of the costs, fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in any such arbitration by the non-prevailing party.  Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court or governmental body having jurisdiction thereof.  Any additional costs, fees or expenses incurred in enforcing the award may be charged against the party that resists its enforcement.  </p>
                
                    <h2>GOVERNING LAW.</h2>

Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement exclusively in a federal court in the District of Colorado, U.S.A. or in state court in Denver, Colorado U.S.A., and You irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding or in any action or proceeding brought in such courts by ReportGrid.  </p>
